Hi, I'm @rodolfoAlejandro. 
I'm interested in developing in Python, C#, SQL, C++, Java, Javascript, because is what I mainly worked with. 
I'm currently learning Kubernetes since I'm currently working in an IT team. I'm also using Ansible for automating system configurations, and Python.
I'm looking to collaborate on any type of project.
You can reach me at rodolfoacastillo90@gmail.com.
